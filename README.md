# Multiplayer Top-Down Shooter

## Ideas

- Roguelike progression system, at the end of the round player gets a new augment (loses weapons and cards), has to directly interact with the cards, cannot be a buff by its own, would prefer if the card system with multipliers stayed the core of the game.
- after picking up the card slow time like in supperhot, so that the player can register what they picked up and have a bit of time to strategize. Perhaps slow down time in just some areas and only for bullets so that melee would still be an option to kill.
